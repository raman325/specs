**2.2.3** **Alarm** **Sensor** **Command** **Class,** **version** **1** **[DEPRECATED]**


**Warning:** **THIS** **COMMAND** **CLASS** **HAS** **BEEN** **DEPRECATED**


A device MAY implement this command class, but it is RECOMMENDED that new implementations use the Notification Command Class.

If implementing this Command Class, it is RECOMMENDED that the Notification Command
Class is also implemented.


The Alarm Sensor Command Class is used to realize Sensor Alarms.


**2.2.3.1** **Alarm** **Sensor** **Get** **Command**


This command is used to request the status of a sensor.


The Alarm Sensor Report Command MUST be returned in response to this command if the sensor
type is supported.


This command MUST NOT be issued via multicast addressing.


A receiving node MUST NOT return a response if this command is received via multicast addressing. The Z-Wave Multicast frame, the broadcast NodeID and the Multi Channel multi-End Point
destination are all considered multicast addressing methods.

**Sensor** **Type** **(8** **bits)**

Sensor Type specifies what type of sensor this command originates from. Refer to Table 2.22. The
sensor type value 0xFF returns the first found supported sensor type in the bit mask (starting from
bit 0 in Bit Mask 1) by the Alarm Sensor Supported Report.


Table 2.22: Alarm Sensor Get::Sensor Type encoding

|Value|Sensor Type|
|---|---|
|0x00|General Purpose Alarm|
|0x01|Smoke Alarm|
|0x02|CO Alarm|
|0x03|CO2 Alarm|
|0x04|Heat Alarm|
|0x05|Water Leak Alarm<br>|

**Source** **Node** **ID** **(8** **bits)**


Specify the source node ID, which detected the alarm condition. In a Zensor Net is it not possible to
determine the source node ID because the frame is broadcast forwarded without this information on

protocol level.


**Sensor** **Type** **(8** **bits)**


Refer to Section 2.2.3.1 Alarm Sensor Get Command.


The Sensor Type 0xFF MUST NOT be advertised in this command.


**Sensor** **State** **(8** **bits)**


The Sensor State parameter returns the current alarm state. The value 0x00 indicates no alarm and
0xFF indicates alarm. Furthermore it can return values from 0x01 to 0x64 to indicate severity of the
alarm in percentage.


The values 0x65…0xFE are reserved and MUST be ignored by receiving nodes.


**Seconds** **(16** **bits)**

The field Seconds indicates time the remote alarm must be active since last received report. The value
0x0000 indicates that the time field MUST be ignored.


**2.2.3.3** **Alarm** **Sensor** **Supported** **Get** **Command**


This command is used to request the supported sensor types from the device.


The Alarm Sensor Supported Report Command MUST be returned in response to this command.


This command MUST NOT be issued via multicast addressing.


A receiving node MUST NOT return a response if this command is received via multicast addressing. The Z-Wave Multicast frame, the broadcast NodeID and the Multi Channel multi-End Point
destination are all considered multicast addressing methods.

This command is used to report the supported sensor types from the device.

|Bit Mask N|Bit Mask N|Bit Mask N|Bit Mask N|Bit Mask N|Bit Mask N|Bit Mask N|Bit Mask N|



**Number** **of** **Bit** **Masks** **(8** **bits)**

Indicates the Number of Bit Masks fields used in bytes.


**Bit** **Mask** **(N** **Bytes)**

The Bit Mask fields describe the supported sensor types by the device.


 - Bit 0 in Bit Mask 1 indicates if Sensor Type = 0 (General Alarm) is supported.


 - Bit 1 in Bit Mask 1 indicates if Sensor Type = 1 (Smoke Alarm) is supported.


 - …


The sensor type is supported if the bit is 1 and the opposite if 0. It is only necessary to send the Bit
Mask fields from 1 and up to the one indicating the last supported sensor type. The number of Bit
Mask fields transmitted MUST be determined from the length field in the frame.

Note that the mapping of bit 1 to Sensor Type =1 differs from the support mapping used by the
Multilevel Sensor Command Class. The Multilevel Sensor Command Class maps bit 0 to Sensor Type
= 1.
