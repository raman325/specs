**2.2.35** **Demand** **Control** **Plan** **Configuration** **Command** **Class,** **version** **1**


The Demand Control Plan Configuration Command Class allows Utility Suppliers to issue and manage
a list of Demand Control Plan (DCP) events to the end consumer.

The DCP Configuration commands are separated for the DCP monitoring commands in the Demand
Control Plan Monitor Command Class, allowing the classes to be optionally supported at different
security levels. (E.g. DCP monitoring commands could be supported using non-secure communication,
while enabling strict secure-only communication for the DCP Configuration Command Class). Refer
to the Security and Security 2 command classes for more details.


A DCP event contains information regarding criticality, products involved, requested reduction, time
duration and if a certain rate (identified by a Demand Control Plan Rate ID, refer to the Rate Table
Configuration Command Class) is associated with the event. When a DCP event is outdated, it is
removed from the list. It is the utility supplier responsibility to prevent overflow of the list by query
the number of free positions in the list before submitting a new DCP event to the list. Each DCP
event is uniquely identified by a timestamp issued the Utility Supplier.


A DCP event may also include information, which enables devices not supporting this class to use in
the Demand Control Plan through the Start & Stop Association Group functionality. The installer,
the end user or Utility Supplier (remote management) configures the Association groups. During the
configuration process the devices are selected and the association entries are created. These associations can additionally be configured with the specific Z-Wave commands (through the Association
Command Configuration Command Class). If no Z-Wave commands are specified in the Associations
groups, it is the responsibility of the device to issue the relevant commands based on Utility Supplier
specific algorithms.


**2.2.35.1** **DCP** **list** **supported** **get** **command**


This command is used to request the total size of the DCP list along with the number of free entries
in the list.


The DCP List Supported Report Command MUST be returned in response to this command.


This command MUST NOT be issued via multicast addressing.


A receiving node MUST NOT return a response if this command is received via multicast addressing. The Z-Wave Multicast frame, the broadcast NodeID and the Multi Channel multi-End Point
destination are all considered multicast addressing methods.

**Timestamp** **-Minute** **Local** **Time** **(8** **bits)**


Specify the number of complete minutes that have passed since the start of the hour (00-59) in local
time.


**Timestamp** **-Second** **Local** **Time** **(8** **bits)**


Specify the number of complete seconds since the start of the minute (00-59) in local time. The value

**DCP** **Rate** **ID** **(8** **bits)**

Specify if a specific rate is applicable when participating in the DCP event. If an entry in the Rata
table contains a matching DCP Rate ID this rate will be active for the duration of the event regardless
of other parameters in the rate is not met.


**DCP** **Rate** **ID** **usage** **Example**

Prior to the DCP events a given rate table is configured defining when rates are active during a
day. The Table contains two entries with DCP Rate IDs allowing the Utility Supplier to activate the
rates outside of the time defined in the Table when a DCP event is placed in the DCP list with the
corresponding DCP rate ID.


Prior to Jul14 2008 two DCP events are placed in the List by the Utility Supplier, which changes the
Rate profile of Jul14 compared to an ‘standard’ day.

**Randomization** **interval** **(8** **bits)**

Specify the randomization interval in units of seconds, which must be applied as an offset to the start
and stopping of the events as requested in the DCP event.

E.g. A value of 0x10 specifies that every device should randomly select a start and stop time offset
between 0 and 16 seconds. This offset SHOULD be applied to the start and duration fields in the
DCP event.


**Number** **of** **DC** **(2** **bits)**

Specify the number of Generic/Specific Device Classes, which are requested to participate in the DCP
event


**Generic** **Device** **Class** **(8bits)**

Specify the load shedding in percentage of average consumption requested for the event. This load
shedding will be applied to the devices with the device classes specified in the command.

This field MUST be in the range 0x01..0x64, which represents values in the range 1%..100%. All other
values are reserved. Reserved values MUST NOT be used by a sending node and MUST be ignored
by a receiving node.


**Start** **Association** **group** **(8** **bits)**


Specify which association group (see the Association Command Class) should be activated when the
event is started. The value 0x00 specifies no group should be activated.

If the device also supports the Association Command Configuration Command Class it possible to
dynamically and remotely (from the Energy Supplier or others) to specify precisely which current and
future Z-Wave commands should be send to which Z-Wave nodes.

The configuration of the Start Association group is done either manually by the installer or automatically when the device detect other relevant devices


**Stop** **Association** **group** **(8** **bits)**


Specify which association group (see the Association Command Class) should be activated when the
event is stopped. The value 0x00 specifies no group should be activated.

The configuration of the Stop Association group is done either manually by the installer or automatically when the device detect other relevant devices


**Start** **Associating** **group** **and** **Stop** **Associating** **Group** **usage** **example**


A small energy control system consisting of a device supporting the DCP command class and 3 Z-Wave
devices which can participate in the application. NodeId 1: Setback Thermostat device, NodeId 8:
Simple Thermostat device, NodeId 5: Multilevel Power Switch device.

Through the use of the Association Command Class and the Association Command Configuration
Command Class the following Associations has been established in the device.


Group 1


Node1, Thermostat_Setback_Set(permanent override,energy saving mode)


Node8, Thermostat_Setpoint_Set(Heating setpoint#1, 19,5oC)


Node5, Multilevel_Switch:Set (Dimlevel =0x20)


Group 2


=
Node1, Thermostat_Setback_Set(No override,Setback 0oC)


Node8, Thermostat_Setpoint_Set(Heating setpoint#1, 21,5oC)


Node5, Multilevel_Switch:Set (Dimlevel =0x40)

A DCP event can now specifically invoke Group1 when starting the event and invoking group2 when
stopping the event by specifying Start Association Group=0x01 and Stop Association Group=0x02.


**2.2.35.4** **DCP** **list** **remove**


This command is used to remove a DCP event from the DCP list.
